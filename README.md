# Intro
In this project, we will be building a summarization appusing streamlit, spacy,gensim and sumy. The NLP app will consist of two parts.

 >Summarizer
 
 >Text Extracted from a URL
 
We will be using displacy from spacy to display our Named Entity in a nice html format on our front end.
Streamlit makes it quite easy to convert our python code into production ready applications. 

# Let us see the basic idea and workflow of our app. The basic workflow of our app includes

>Receiving Text Input From User using streamlit st.text_area() and st.text_input() functions.

>Summarizing our Received Text Using Gensim,Sumy and any other packages such as NLTK or SpaCy.

>Extracting Text From a Given URL using BeautifulSoup and Urllib or Request.

>Entity Recognition using Spacy.

>Rendering our Extracted Named Entities using Displacy and Streamlit.
